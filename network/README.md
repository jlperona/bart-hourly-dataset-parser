# Network files

Both of the files below are provided in the Pajek NET format.

## `bart.net`

This is the base file, with the station names being the entire name.
This file is good for use with programs like Gephi.

## `bart-abbreviations.net`

This is the same file as above, except with the station names swapped out for their 4-letter abbreviations.
This is more suitable for use in something like `igraph`.
